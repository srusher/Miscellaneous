# The Math Game

## What does this program do?
This is a relatively simple math game which uses the Random class to generate a series of numbers over a loop which can be displayed to the user in the form of an arithmetic question. The version I have ceated will only ask the user to perform simple math operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## File-Type
The .cs file in this repository contains the code for the program. I used the Visual Studio 2019 environmentto develop this program.
